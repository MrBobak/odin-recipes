<h3>Descrption</h3>
<p>Flaki or flaczki is a traditional Polish tripe soup. Dense and meaty, the soup is traditionally served during Polish weddings as a part of the hot courses of the festivity. The dish is often served with a fresh bread roll on the side. The name flaki refers to its main ingredientâ€“strips of beef tripe.

    Flaki was known since the 14th century in Poland, and it was one of the favorite dishes of King Wladyslaw Jagiello. Today, some cooks like to add smoked bacon to the dish, as well as additional seasonings such as pepper, ginger, or nutmeg. If meatballs are added to the soup, the dish is then known as flaki po warszawsku (Warsaw-style flaki).</p>
