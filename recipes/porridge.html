    <img src="../img/owsianka.jpg">

    <h3>Descrption</h3>
        <p>Porridge can be cooked in plain cow's milk or plant-based milk (drink). In the dietary version, you can use water and, after cooking, mix it with natural yoghurt.</p>
        <p>Porridge can be sweetened with sugar, honey or maple syrup. Additives, such as nuts and seasonal fruit, play an important role. Try to sprinkle your porridge with maple syrup and citrus juice!</p>
        <p>In the off-season, we can use frozen fruit, e.g. raspberries or various types of fruit preserves, for fresh berries. In winter, we can try exotic fruits such as banana, orange, mango and passion fruit. </p>
